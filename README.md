## Development

```bash
pre-commit install
```

```

This will lint and fix any styling issues in your code acoording to the code style described [here](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#pragmatism)

## Usage
### Commands

If you have the skill installed on your account, you can call it on Alexa by saying:

- `Alexa, I want to ask jee pee tee a question`

Alexa will confirm and ask you what do you want to know about. You can then follow up with any question, for example:

- What is the capital of France?
- Who was the first President of the United States?
- What is the square root of 144?
- How do you make a chocolate cake?
- What is the current time in New York City?

This skill also allows a direct relay of the question with a single command:

- `Alexa, ask jee pee tee about our solar system`
- `Alexa, ask jee pee tee to explain the NP theorem`

__Note: The interaction model only supports a couple ways to start a direct question. If you want to ask a question in a different way, you can always start with the first command and follow up with the question.__
